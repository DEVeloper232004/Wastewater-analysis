# Wastewater-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing water quality by evaluating Total Suspended Solids (TSS), carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and flow rates across multiple locations to identify pollution trends and optimize wastewater treatment. Using Power BI, Tableau, and data visualization techniques.
By integrating Machine Learning (ML) models with TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn, predictive algorithms are developed to forecast fluctuations in contamination levels, allowing for early intervention and data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, simulation software like MATLAB, ASPEN PLUS, and DWSim is employed to model treatment plant efficiencies, optimize filtration processes, and improve chemical dosing strategies. The project highlights the importance of real-time monitoring, AI-driven automation, and predictive analytics in ensuring regulatory compliance, enhancing treatment efficiency, and promoting sustainable water resource management. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, this study provides actionable insights for enhanced environmental protection, cost reduction in wastewater management, and long-term sustainability in water conservation efforts.
